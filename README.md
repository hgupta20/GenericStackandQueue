# GenericStackandQueue
Implementation of generic class for stack and queue

The stack is one of the popular data structure which supports LIFO (Last In First OUT) operation. 
Due to LIFO advantage, you can use stack data structure to convert a recursive algorithm to an iterative one.

Here's an example of both stack and queue implemented by generic data types. 
For instance, I want to create a stack which should accept only string objects. Similarly I want to create a queue which accepts only 
integers. We can implement this using generics bound type. Using this you can add group of objects from the same family as well.
